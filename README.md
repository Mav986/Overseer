# Overseer
Overseer is a general purpose bot I built for the Weebfleet discord server. While the command
list is fairly sparse for the moment, I plan to flesh it out as time goes on. It's not really
intended to be distributed, but I'll leave some instructions on running it anyway.

### Usage
Download the executable to the location of your choice. 

Go to 
[the discord developer portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/), create an
application, and add a bot to it. Copy the bot token, and add it as an environment variable with
the name "OverseerToken".

Run the bot executable.
